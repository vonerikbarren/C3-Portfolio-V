# Pseudocode for Project

## Overview for Project 

## Notes
- Build this tomorrow 
- Start on design first

## Stage 1 - Designing the Website
1. Find 5 basic minimal sites and get ideas
2. Find a common theme that I can either build from or build myself 
3. When creating the layout, use concepts on iPad Pro
4. When working on the iPad Pro, remember to build assets and saving them in the tool bar for continued use. 
5. Create something minimalistic and yet triggering for the users to see and to experience. 
6. We are using bootstrap so its important we use grid numbers within our assets and have those as reusable assets we can design with in the future.

## Stage 2 - Gathering the Assets necessary
1. We have two websites, vecteezy and the icon website we spend money on paying so we need to use both moving forward. --> Focus on SVG images and maybe png images. 
2. When using our gradients, lets focus on sectional gradients that can blend in with a main color for the whole page. That way we can be more creative with our assets and how they can look, or how we can hover over them. 
3. However apps we are going to start learning, we need to implement those soon at least 5 so we can have several projects up and running to be viewed. 
4. If we are using any gifs or jpegs on the site, remember that the height and width must be defined within the <img> tag. 
5. Finally for animations, we should learn how to use more features of gsap and implement them in the portfolio. Try to make reusable code. 

## Stage 3 - Creating the Grid
1. Using the grid from our design, try my best to implement the grid system from design into website. Use jumbotrons where necessary and also have a central css file for the page. 
2. If there are any animations specifically on the grid system itself, that should be programmed as well to keep with our workflow. 
3. Begin re-creating the design onto the website and include the Navbar at the top of the page. 


## Stage 4 - Developing the Website 
1. When developing make sure that we work form a functional perspective and add design and more features as we move along the project. 

## Stage 5 - Finishing the Website 
1. Create a website from the github settings on the repo and make it available for public. 
2. Try to figure out how to change the name of the github repo website url if possible.
