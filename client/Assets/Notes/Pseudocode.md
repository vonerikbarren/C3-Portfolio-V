# Pseudocode for Project

## Overview for Project 

## Notes
- Build this tomorrow 
- Start on design first

## Stage 1 - Designing the Website
1. Find 5 basic minimal sites and get ideas
2. Find a common theme that I can either build from or build myself 
3. When creating the layout, use concepts on iPad Pro
4. When working on the iPad Pro, remember to build assets and saving them in the tool bar for continued use. 
5. Create something minimalistic and yet triggering for the users to see and to experience. 

## Stage 2 - Gathering the Assets necessary
1. We have two websites, vecteezy and the icon website we spend money on paying so we need to use both moving forward. --> Focus on SVG images and maybe png images 

## Stage 3 - Creating the Grid

## Stage 4 - Developing the Website 

## Stage 5 - Finishing the Website
